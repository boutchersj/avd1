  /*Bezier curves live in a 1-by-1 coordinate grid, and there are 4 points:
  -p0 (0,0)
  -p1 (?,?)
  -p2 (?,?)
  -p3 (1,1)
  
  You have to set the middle 2 points to determine the timing of your animation*/
  
  //This method gives you more precise control over the rate than the preset keywords//
