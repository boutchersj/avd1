//The box-shadow property of an element lets you put a shadow effect around the border of the element to give a 3-D effect//
//It takes values of offset-x, offset-y, [blur-radius, spread-radius], and color value, in that order, with the 3rd 2 optional//
//Blur radius determines how far the blur effect on the shadow goes from the element//
//Spread radius determines how thick the shadow is//
