  //Tertiary colors (ex: orange) are formed by combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors on the color wheel//
  //The split-complementary color scheme is a subtler version of the contrast offered by complementary colors side by side//
  //Take one base color, then find the 2 colors adjacent on the color wheel to its complement//
